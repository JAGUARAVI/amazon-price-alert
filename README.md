# Amazon prices keep fluctuating- Let's scrape them!
 C3PO is a web-scraper built on BeautifulSoup that alerts you when the price of an amazon prduct falls within your budget! Currently in development.
 
 ## What is the use?
 Nothing is worse than seeing the price drop of a product you just bought on Amazon drop 2 days after you bought it. Wouldn't it be amazing if a python script could just 
 ask you your budget and the product link and then notify you when the product price drops below that? This is exactly what this script does!
 
 ## How to use 
 Simply copy-paste the link of the product and your budget- that's it! The scraper will do the rest for you and notify you when the price is in your budget.
